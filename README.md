# gnome-extensions-bottom-panel

Simple GNOME Extension for risiOS that moves the panel to the bottom.

Full credit to [Just Perfection](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrahmatzadeh) because I ripped most of his code off, mainly because I wanted this one feature without needing to ship the entire Just Perfection extension with risiOS (Great extension, but I'm trying to keep it mostly Vanilla with only a couple changes).

### Supports:
GNOME 41
